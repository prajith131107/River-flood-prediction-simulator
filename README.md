ABSTRACT 
Floods are one of the most dangerous natural disasters affecting millions of people every year. 
Early prediction and timely alerts are crucial to minimize damage. 
The River Flood Prediction Simulator is a Python-based application that predicts flood risk 
using rainfall data, river water levels, soil moisture, and discharge rate. Machine Learning 
algorithms analyze historical data to forecast flood conditions and display alerts through visual 
graphs. 
This project demonstrates how data science and artificial intelligence can improve disaster 
preparedness and reduce loss of life and property. 

INTRODUCTION 
Flood prediction plays a vital role in disaster management. Traditional systems often depend on 
manual monitoring, which is time-consuming and inaccurate. 
This project automates flood prediction using machine learning models, making the process 
faster, reliable, and scalable.

● Lack of real-time prediction systems 
● Insufficient analysis of multiple environmental factors

OBJECTIVES 
● Predict river flood levels accurately 
● Analyze multiple environmental parameters 
● Provide early warning alerts 
● Visualize flood risk levels
